                    Remembering Reads is a simple way to remember all of the books you have previously read.
                    As soon as you've finished reading your current book, use our simple form to fill out a book report.
                    Never again will someone ask "What was that book you read about" and your response being "... I remember there were aliens.. and.. government..."
